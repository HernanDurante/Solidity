# Solidity

Sample smart contract and DApp featuring a simple logic that allows users to vote on a binary proposal.
To use it, follow this steps:<br/>
 1 - Compile and migrate the smart contract to your local instance of Ganache.<br/>
 2 - Add Ganache's accounts to Metamask.<br/>
 3 - Change the value of 'pollAddress' variable in DApp's app.js to the address of your deployed contact.<br/>
 4 - Run the DApp using an http server such as http-server (https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server), metamask does not work
 properly running the DApp directly from file.
